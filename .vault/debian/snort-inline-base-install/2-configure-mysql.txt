Create Snort Database, User, Security

mysql -u root -p
show databases;
drop user '';       # Delete anonymous user
create database snort_log;
create database snort_archive;
grant CREATE,DELETE,INSERT,UPDATE,SELECT on snort_log.* to snort@localhost;
grant CREATE,DELETE,INSERT,UPDATE,SELECT on snort_archive.* to snort@localhost;
SET PASSWORD FOR snort@localhost=PASSWORD('marleeandmeasyouwishfib');
flush privileges;
exit;

Import an old database if there is one, otherwise import a database schema.

mysql -u root -p snort_log < snort_log.sql
mysql -u root -p snort_archive < snort_archive.sql

bzcat /usr/share/doc/snort-<version>/schemas/create_mysql.bz2 | mysql -u root -p snort_log

Note: importing to snort_archive didn't work as I expected it to, not all tables in the database were created, instead I had to output snort_log and import it to snort_archive:

mysqldump --opt -u root -p snort_log > snort_structure.sql
mysql -u root -p snort_archive < snort_structure.sql

Check to see if structure was created:

mysql -u root -p snort
show tables;
exit;
